My Language V0.2.9f 0000000 00-00-0000
Prealpha *ALPHA DEADLINE NEWYEARS*
======================================

Caution: early versions will probably be about as stable as a house of cards built atop of jenga towers sitting on a card table.
Code accordingly.

FUNCTIONS
---------

as a general rule:
- a function in ALL CAPS is a binary operator, which returns it's result, or a control function, which doesn't return.
- infix symbols are binary operators as above
- prefix symbols change how the thing they are attatched to is interpreted
- postfix symbols change a variable in place
- a function in lowercase needs it's arguments in (parenthases), and has it's return specified
- a symbol is a binary operator or a unary operator, and returns it's result
any returned array will be 1 dimensional.

My language will have the following functions:

wait(foo) , ⌛foo : wait for foo milliseconds, returns void
time() : returns the current real time, timtyp
clock() : return the current program time, clktyp
beep() : print \a, returns void

IF (foo) {...} : if foo is true, do the function enclosed in {}.
ELSE {...} : if the function if fails, do the function enclosed in {}.
ELSEIF (foo) {...} : single-tier version of ELSE {IF (foo) {}}
WHILE (foo) {...} : loop the function enclosed in {} until foo is false.
UNTIL (foo) {...} : loop the function enclosed in {} until foo is true.
BREAK : immediately exit the current loop
GOTO (foo) : go to label foo. NOTE: there is no return function. putting a goto inside a function declaration can screw up your control flow.
DOTIMES (foo) ❬x❭ {...} : do whatever is in {} foo times. if foo is a float, rounds down. if foo is infinity, you're trying too hard to break things. the loop counter is stored in the variable noted by x.
¶foo : a label called foo. Please don't put these INSIDE loops unless you know what you're doing.
NOP, NOOP, NOPR, CONTINUE, SWYM: reserved commands that do nothing. The parser eats these.
If you GOTO out of a WHILE or DOTIMES, the parser will think you are still in that loop! This does not apply to IF, ELSEIF, or ELSE.

printf(...) : print a formatted value to stdout, as in C. returns as in C. Formats as in C.
sprintf(...) : print a formatted value to variable, as in C. returns as in C. Formats as in C.

fputs(...) : write a string to a file, as in C. returns as in C. Formats as in C.
fflush(...) : flush an output file, as in C. returns as in C. Formats as in C.
fopen(...) : open a file as a stream, as in C. returns as in C. Formats as in C.
fclose(...) : close a stream, as in C. returns as in C. Formats as in C.
fseek(...) : go to an offset in a file, as in C. returns as in C. Formats as in C.
ftell(...) : get the current offset in a file, as in C. returns as in C. Formats as in C.
rewind(...) : go to the beginning of a file, as in C. returns as in C. Formats as in C.

write(foo, ...) : write the strings or variables to file foo, similar to Pascal. convert formats automaticaly.
writeln(foo, ...) : write the strings or variables to file foo and append a newline, similar to Pascal. convert formats automaticaly.
read(foo, ...) : read the next field from a file, similar to Pascal. foo is the file, subsequent arguments are variables.

fread(...) : read raw data from a file, as in C. returns as in C.
fwrite(...) : write raw data to a file, as in C. returns as in C.

FUNCTION foo(...) {...} : define a function foo. () contains an exaustive list of the internal names of arguments, {} contains the function itself.
VARIADIC foo(bar, baz) ❬x❭ {...} : define a function foo. bar and baz are fixed arguments, {} contains the function itself, and x are iterated arguments beyond those listed.
EXTERN FOO bar(...) : define an external function that takes standard linkage. FOO is the type the function returns, using this language's names. If types are the same width, this can be used to reformat the raw data of the returned function.

FOO bar, baz, quux : where FOO is a valid datatype, make variables bar, baz, and quux of that type
FOO bar[quux] {...} : make an array bar of size quux with entries of type FOO. More square brackets can be added as waldo[garply][plugh][xyzzy] to define a multi dimensional array.
STATIC FOO bar, baz, quux : where FOO is a valid datatype, make static variables bar, baz, and quux of that type
foo[bar][quux] : the quux-th element of the bar-th column of array foo
STRUCT FOO {...} : create a structured datatype FOO with the keys named in {}. Each must have it's type specified, but new fields can be added to variables later as in C.
foo.bar : the field bar from the variable foo, where foo is a structure. foo.bar is not a valid variable name otherwise because of this syntax, use foo_bar.
foo>>>bar , foo➤bar : structure pointer. can be chained togeather, like baz➤quux➤garply, if the field quux in baz is a pointer to another struct or similar type.
foo...bar , foo…bar : an array of pointers to the structure field bar from the linked list foo. all are the type of the first such field in the list.

Final implementation will group non-byte datatypes into byte sized blocks.
(i.e. 4 bools will grouped together to make a byte)
(C can't do this, but this language as written, with disregard to back end, should be able to implement a compiler to do it.)

functions for transfinites, base-60 numbers, and graphics deferred.

Parseing
--------
comments, and \ have the absolute highest priority.
quotes, single or double, come next.
functions inside parenthases, normal functions(), and special bracket functions, have the highest precedance of true operators
prefix operators are evaluated inside to out. this includes unary functions, inquiries, splat, pointers, and base signs. be mindful of applying large chains of these (splat interprets anything attatched the left of it as a variable, number signs cannot be applied to strings, pointers applied to numbers are VERY DANGEROUS)
structure dots and structure pointers are evaluated next
infix mathmatical operators are next, then tests (set theory, then [in]equality, then bitwise, lastly logical);
postfix operator assignments are evaluated next to last.
assignments, extraction, and insertion are evaluated last.

If fields are seperated by commas, the fields will be resolved compleatly before moving on to the next one left to right.
functions such as return, {}, ;, newline, and control functions are evaluated differently. they control how other functions are evaluated.

Mathmatical operators follow standard order of operations.
logic and bitwise operators follow the order not, and, or, nand, nor, xor, xnor. not is actually considered a prefix or function.
Operators other than assignment-type operators (:=, :<, :>) are evaluated left to right; assignment precedent is REVERSED OF THIS.

SPECIAL VARIABLES
-----------------
stdout : the output file
stdin : the input file
stderr : the error file
NULL : a null file or bitbucket, implemented as a null pointer.
ⅈ : √-1, for complex numbers. (the variable "i" is antireserved as too generic)
ℯ : eulars number, double. (the variable "euler" is antireserved for i.e. user defined approximations) 
π : pi, double. (The variable "pi" is antireserved for i.e. user defined approximations)
φ : (1+√5)/2, double. (the variable "phi" is antireserved for i.e. user defined approximations. ϕ is antireserved for i.e. the second angle in a spherical coordinate system)
∞ , infinity : infinity. Currently a double, may be changed to a special, more compact type for special numbers.
� , notanumber : quiet Not a Number. Currently a double, may be changed to a special, more compact type for special numbers. (symbol is literal U+FFFD)
true : bool of 1
false : bool of 0
ternary : bool of -1

formating
---------

§comment : if § occurs unescaped on a line, the rest of the line is ignored, or until ;

numbers, where foo and bar are strings of digits 1234567890, as well as aAbBcCdDeEfF for hexadecimal
foo : decimal
$foo : hexadecimal
%foo : binary
-foo : negitive signed decimal
@foo : octal
foo.bar : float
-foo.bar : negitive float

there is no syntax defined for negitive binary, hexadecimal, or octal numbers

Variable names should only consist of letters to prevent unexpected behavior.
using high adress characters may cause an increse in application size

The assignment operator is :=, as in algol or pascal
An insertion operator, :<, and extraction operator, :>, are also avalible

a Unicode alternitive for assignment is ≝
Unicode alternitives for insertion and extraction are ⤆ and ⤇

"this is a string"
'this is also a string'

a newline, ; or ⏎ appearing before a string is closed will be interpreted as a newline,
but will cause the parser to generate a warning about the virtues of escape sequences.
a \ followed by whitespace or newline will generate a warning telling you how to properly escape an escape character.

FOR (foo) {this is a grouping}
FOR (foo)
{
this is a multiline grouping
}

FOO bar[4] {this, is, an, array}

FOO bar[2][3]
{
{this, is, a}
{2, dimensional, array}
}

FOO bar[2][2][2]
{
{
{this, is}
{an, array}
}
{
{that, contains}
{three, dimensions}
}
}

FOO bar[2][2] {{newlines, are}{not, required}}

FOO bar[2][2][2] {neither, are, subgroupings, they, are, just, for, readability}

escape character \
special character shortcuts are as in C except as noted above.

adressing and inquiring
-----------------------

&foo : the adress of foo
*foo : pointer to foo
?foo : indicates the type of foo, same as typeof(foo)
¿foo : indicates the recursive type of foo, same as classof(foo)
№foo : indicates whether foo is a number, same as isnumber(foo)
±foo : the sign of foo, same as signof(foo)
ℓfoo : the size of foo, same as sizeof(foo)
£foo(bar) : splat an array foo here. same as foo[0], foo[1], foo[2]...

WARNING! using & or * on a decimal, hexidecimal, binary, or octal interger will read the ABSOLUTE ADDRESS.
This is an INTENDED RESPONSE, not a bug. IF YOU USE THIS ON A PRE-EXISTING OPERATING SYSTEM, ON YOUR HEAD BE IT.

DATATYPES
---------

BOOL : 2 bits <currently implementation dependent>
BYTE : 8 bits unspecified sign
WORD : 16 bits unspecified sign
LONG : 32 bits unspecified sign
QUAD : 64 bits unspecified sign
S_[BYTE|WORD|LONG|QUAD] : signed versions of above
U_[BYTE|WORD|LONG|QUAD] : unsigned versions of above
STRING : utf8 ansi-style string. multibyte characters are stored internaly as multiple characters.
C_INT : C's generic Interger datatype. here for compatibility. Width is implementation dependent.
FLOAT : single precision float
DOUBLE : double precision float
ARRAY : array of anythings, so long as all entries are the same size. can be multidimensional if rectangular/cuboid/hypercuboid.
FILE : a C-style file
LLIST : a doubly-linked list. implemented as a collection of nodes.
NODE : a structure consisting of a pointer .prev, an anything .data, and a pointer .next
TREERT : the root of a tree of leaves.
LEAF : a structure consisting of a pointer .parent, and an anything .data
TIMTYP : a structure for holding C style real times.
CLKTYP : an number type for storing the C-style elapsed time.
DIVTYP : the result of div. a struct with fields numer and denom.
SIZTYP : the result of sizeof. an unsigned int.
TYPTYP : a structure for use in the type tree.
PATTRN : a compiled regex
VOID : a nothing 0 bits wide
NULL : the type of NULL. Technicaly assignable, but will cause most functions to catch the variable with null handling before the value is read.

"detonation" in this document refers to a fatal crash
int in this document refers to a byte, word, long, or quad (either signed or unsigned), c_int, or clktyp
number in this document refers to an int, a float, or double

assigning a negitive or overflowing number to an int will not affect it, since the format is unspecified, so long as the number is within range
assigning a negitive number to an unsigned int will detonate
assigning a number to any int that is outside the range supported by that format will detonate
assigning a value to a pointer should never fail, but may cause strange behavior

math typing: int FOO single = single, [int | single] FOO double = double
math typeing in current versions also does C-style interger promotions, and is spotty at best for parenthases functions. THIS IS A BUG (bug#0).
operations dealing with bytes SHOULD not return a word or long unless the value overflows a byte.
operations dealing in signed values SHOULD return a signed value unless the returned value is positive and too large to hold.
all math functions should return the smallest length type possible, and use this type for calculation unless architecture makes this impractical.
Strings and NOWHERE evaluate to Quiet_NaN in math fuctions.
Non-empty strings evaluate as true if taken with =foo in logic functions. =NULL evaluates as false.

While the language may be initialy written for i686 and x86_64, it was concieved for the 68020+68881.
A backport for 680x0 will be made avalible for the first system whos calling conventions can be located and demystifyed.
a barebones embedded Z80 implementation for system design is also planned

Error strings should all be converted to NULL or NaN

DEFINEING FUNCTIONS
-------------------

a function can be defined as follows:

FUNCTION foo(bar, quux)
	{
	if(bar < quux) {return bar}
	elseif(bar > quux) {return quux}
	else {return �}
	}

this will make a function that returns the lesser of two numbers, bar and quux.
Note there is no checking to see if bar or quux are numbers.
If bar or quux are not numbers, the function will detonate.
a function can return more than one type, hence it is not necessary to say what it's return type is like in C


EXAMPLES
--------
mandatory hello world program.
Unlike C, but like older languages and modern interpreted languages,
there is no main function required. one could define a main function
and call it at the end of the program, but this is unneccisary.
It is recommended to have things defined before you use them, however. The compiler doesn't read that far ahead.

Example 1:
printf("Hello, World!\n")

Example 2:
cout :< "Hello, World!" ¢ "\n"

Example 3:
writeln(cout, "Hello, World!")

Note that all examples are only 1 line of code.

cross compilation and assembly-only implementation for Z80 embedded system design

BUILDING
--------
The source for the first alpha version is projected to need:
- a POSIX shell
- a Make utility
- a C compiler
- a C++ compiler
- a C preprocessor that can be called independently
- an Assembler
- a Linker
- RE/flex
- yacc or bison
- curl (to ensure the most current unicode files)

future rewrites may also require
- an M4 macro processor
- a Rust compiler


Yes, this first alpha version is expected to be huge in size and have dozens of intermidiate object files. I expect it to get bigger, not smaller, as there is a 1:1 corraspondance between primary functions and object files.
This is because the alpha version will be only the first and second step in a bootstrapping process, and the first revision of them at that.
I do expect the final version of the bootstrapping process to gradually get smaller after the third iteration as external object files are rolled into a single file and optimized. I'm probably wrong.
The use of the C preprocessor may change in a future version.
I don't forsee needing any other languages for the commands I've included, but I can forsee complications which may arise that could call for the ones in the second list. the two lists taken together covers most of my useful programming skills. amoungst the languages that I will definately NOT be including is Cobol.
This language is designed for POSIX-compliant enviroments. Barring a signifigant change in policy by Microsoft, Windows support is unlikely to be feasible, but may be possible by extra-ordinary mesures (like compleatly reimplimenting everything about how unicode is implemented internaly).

Primary functions
-----------------
A primary function is a function that is included in the first step of the bootstrapping process. CPP Macros don't count.
Any built-in function that is a function that is not a primary function is called a "secondary function", and can be implemented with primary functions.
Some primary functions that could be implemented as secondary functions are meant to be different on the backend from such an implementation, are required in the second iteration, or are absolutely trivial.

This language standard does not mandate that the functions are implemented in the languages specified; Ideally, they could all be reduced to a single language.
Starting at iteration 3, I plan to implement both a Static Compiler and an APL transpiler. Iteration 3 is also the first iteration to have all the built-ins.
Here is a list of how I implement built-ins in the first 2 iterations:

function : 1st iteration , 2nd iteration (* indicates that a function could be implemented in the next round, but is trivial in the formal sense)

PARSING (CONTINUED)
-------------------

a variable name and function name may not overlap

a name may not contain any technical symbol. these include:
' " ; : [ ] { } | \ < > , . ? / ~ ` ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) - + =
❬ ❭ ⟦ ⟧ ⌊ ⌋ ⌈ ⌉ ↯ ¶ ➤ … × ÷ ⋆ ⍟ √ ¡ ∧ ∨ ⍲ ⍱ ⊕ ↔ ≡ » « → ← ¬ ⇔
∈ ∪ ∩ ⊂ ⊖ ≤ ≥ ≠ ≈ ¢ ≝ £ ¿ № ± ℓ ⏎ ↵ ↹ ⇥ ␣ ⍽ ⌛ ⎋ ⚠ 💣 ☠

a name may not contain a number as the first character
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

a name may not overlap exactly with a special variable.
stdin stdout stderr cin cout cerr clog NULL ⅈ ℯ π φ ∞ infinity � notanumber true false ternary

a name may not overlap exactly with a builtin function
[set of all functions]

The compiler automatically generates a type tree and associated variables for each variable and type. They follow the form:
type_of_[variablename] type_table_[typename]
Be mindful of these when naming your variables, as collisions will screw up type checking
these are always structures of typtyp

a variable name may not contain an unprintable character
␀ ␁ ␂ ␃ ␄ ␅ ␆ ␇ ␈ ␉ ␊ ␋ ␌ ␍ ␎ ␏ ␐ ␑ ␒ ␓ ␔ ␕ ␖ ␗ ␘ ␙ ␚ ␛ ␜ ␝ ␞ ␟ ␠ ␡

forbidden symbols will NEVER include (antireserved):
_ ¦ · • ♠ ♡ ♢ ♣ ♤ ♥ ♦ ♧ ♔ ♕ ♖ ♗ ♘ ♙ ♚ ♛ ♜ ♝ ♞ ♟ ː ˑ ⫶ [set of all unicode letters]

Tokens are seperated by "Whitespace". This does not follow the standard unicode definition of "Whitespace".
Whitespace can be specified manually at metacompilation time. By default, this includes:
␠ ␉ ↹ ⇥ ␣ ⍽ <all breaking spaces>

Lines are seperated by specially defined characters. This can be chosen, too. by default, this includes:
␊ ␍ ; ⏎ ↵

MAX_BUFFER is a value used in string and file operations. it defaults to 512 bytes. This is the amount of memory allocated for buffer reads.

TYPE TREE
the type tree contains the names of all types. any user defined types are automatically added to the type tree.

VERSION NUMBERS
---------------
major version : a number that represents the full version number
minor version : the number of minor revisions since the last time the version number was changed
revision : tiny revisions since last minor version
documentation version : the version of the documentation for the minor version. appears as a letter (starting at a) following the full version number when the previous documentation for the same version was errornous, ommited otherwise.
testbuild number : the sequential testbuild number
testbuild date : the date of the testbuild

format: Ver.major.minor[doc] #NUMBER DD-MM-YYYY
