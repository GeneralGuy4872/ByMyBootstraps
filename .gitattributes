#norlang was a discontinued project of mine from a long time ago. It was supposed to be a hardware descriptor language for logic gates,
#but I didn't have any idea how to write a proper language at that point, and lua sandboxes just wouldn't cut it. I'm still stumped, but I might revisit it later.
*.zzzz = linguist-language=unknown
#my magnum opus, this language has been described by at least 1 person as "an anti-rust", however I think of it as an extended B.
#it is loosely typed, both very high and ultralow level, and has syntax that switches between C-like and Mainframe-era flawlessly.
#It is an amalgum of several other languages, taking the functions I like and rolling them all up in 1 place.
#The most visible influence is the use of Unicode symbols for some functions, which was inspired by APL.
